This is the documentation of Thib's personal infrastructure. Disaster Recovery Plans include documentation about a setup that is as foolproof as possible. Since maintaining documentation is expensive, doing it collaboratively allows us to dillute the costs within the community.

## Is this for you?

This documents aims to be a comprehensive guide to deploy a _limited_ set of services _and maintain them in the long run_. It should be general purpose enough to help hobbyist with a basic understanding of Linux to get started and learn along the way.

By following this documentation you can learn to deploy your own self-hosted server with a decent level of confidence that your are doing things right at your scale. It can help you grow your skills, and why not grow a career in the field.

## Sharing the costs of documentation

The more people use a deployment similar to this one, the more this documentation takes value, the less expensive it is to maintain thanks to the eyes of all the hobbyist contributing to it.
