## What is this project?

This is the documentation of Thibâ€™s personal infrastructure. Disaster Recovery Plans include documentation about a setup that is as foolproof as possible. Since maintaining documentation is expensive, doing it collaboratively allows us to dillute the costs within the community.

You are welcome to try this documentation and deploy your setup with it. Bear in mind this documentation doesn't come with any warranty of any kind, and that the issue tracker is not meant for customer support. You're on your own, but it's a fun adventure!

## What not to expect from this project?

This documentation is very opinionated. Even if the "Learning the concepts" section should be generic enough to empower people to roll out their own set-ups, this documentation is not meant to be generic. It is not meant to document how to deploy all the cool services out there, but aims to remain minimal.

It will remain RHEL-derivatives centric, with a minimal set of services deployed. Make sure you [read the FAQ](https://docs.ergaster.org/overview/faq/) before contributing.
